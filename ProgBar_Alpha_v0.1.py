# new program
# ProgBar_Alphav0.1
# The purpose of this program is to take Longitude and Latitude inputs
# and calculate the distance between them.

# Phase 1 - Manual Inpout
# Manual coordinates will be used

# We have our function that calculates distance between two coordinates
# With that we have a zero distance for the progress bar being empty, and
# a max distance for it being full. But we need a third variable that serves
# as the bars current status. After the first input the Start coordinate
# (lat/lon1) and the End coordinate (lat/lon2) won't change. However, the
# third variable will. Because of that we need a the program to check for
# changes in our third variable.

# Let's define our start and end coordinates
lat1  = 0 # Working coordinate 1 latitude
lon1  = 0 # Working coordinate 1 longitude
lat2  = 0 # Working coordinate 2 latitude
lon2  = 0 # Working coordinate 2 longitude
# This is our variable coordinate
lat3  = 0 # Working coordinate 3 latitude
lon3  = 0 # Working coordinate 3 longitude
Tlat3 = 0 # Temp coordinate 3 latitude
Tlon3 = 0 # Temp coordinate 3 longitude

# Let's fill the variables
def set_vars(lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2,lat3,lon3,Tlat3,Tlon3):

# Run haversine() to get total distance
